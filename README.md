# Hydrogen-orbitals

in this project, focus was put more on the mathematical bases of this topic, not the coding part.
anyway, if you are intrested in code, its really basic, no advanced packages were used, just some equations applied.

more intresting is .pdf file in which you can read about these equations, where they come from and what does all of this mean.
Note, that .pdf is in Polish, but equations can be still understood so dont let that discourage you. Enjoy!
